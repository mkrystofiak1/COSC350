Description: Lab6 Task3 Description

The forkWait.c program is almost the same as the fork1.c, however when it calls the child and parent 
processes, it instead waits for the child to finish running before terminating the program. The orig
onal program (fork1.c) ran until just parent was done, and then terminated, but child kept going until
it reached it's desired itterations.
